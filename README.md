# COEN2310-DiscreteMathematics-FinalProject
Discrete Mathematics final project

## Project Description:

This project consists of the implementation of an algorithm that transforms a distance matrix into a connected graph. 
The algorithm is based on the notion of vertices close to a group, where the vertex "x" is close to the group C if d(x,C) < θ, (θ = threshold). 
The graph is transformed by iteratively adding or removing edges if the distance between the vertices is less than the threshold.

## How to Install and Run the Project:

1. Open -> Anaconda Prompt

2. Install requirements:
	- pip install pandas


3. Test the program:
	- Open the Spyder IDE from Anaconda Navigator
	- Open and run the file named main.py

	*make sure that all project files are in the same directory.
